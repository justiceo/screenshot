## Project setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build extension for development, watch for file changes and rebuild.
npm run build
npm run watch

# Generate compliant images assets for logo (default logo location src/assets/logo.png)
npm run generateIcons

# Translate app strings to all supported chrome locales
npm run translate

# Start an instance of Chromium with extension installed (using puppeteer)
# For Firefox, pass --browser=firefox as argument.
npm run start

# Build and package extension into a store-ready upload
node tools/esbuild.js build --prod

# Create extension package for Firefox/Opera/Edge by specifying --browser argument
node tools/esbuild.js build --prod  --browser=firefox

# Run tests
npm run test
```

<details><summary>E2E testing with Firefox.</summary>

By default, puppeteer only downloads Chromium, run the command below to install Firefox's equivalent of chromium:

```
PUPPETEER_PRODUCT=firefox npm i -D puppeteer --prefix ./node_modules/firefox-puppeteer
```

`PUPPETEER_PRODUCT=firefox` tells puppeteer to download firefox.

`--prefix ./node_modules/firefox-puppeteer` forces a new fetch of puppeteer. This is necessary since `node_modules/puppeteer` already exists (for chromium). The actual value of the prefix doesn't matter, just don't overwrite an actual package.

_NB:_ After running the above command, they will no be update to package.json or package-lock.json... since package "puppeteer" already exists.

## Features

- **Typescript to Js**: Write your entire chrome extension in Typescript and have it transpiled to JavaScript.
- **E2E extension test**: Start up a chrome browser with your extension installed, write your tests in Jasmine.
- **Generate extension icons**: Forget the pain of generating icons of different size to meet icons requirements.
- **Manifest V3 Compatible**: Easier submission to the Chrome Webstore.
- **Automatic translation**: The messages for all supported i18n locales are auto-generated from the English version.
- **Zero Dependencies**: This starter is minimal to avoid [supply-chain attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/npm-supply-chain-attack-impacts-hundreds-of-websites-and-apps/) which is rampant with Js projects.
- **Welcome and Uninstall pages**: To give your project a head start, welcome pages are great for demos and uninstall pages provide a thoughtful exit.
- **Utilities for common tasks**: Comes with helpers logging, storage, and requesting feedback.
